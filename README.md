# drone-maps

Web viewer for drone orthophoto maps generated by WebODM/ODM.

## Quick Start

1. **Optimize the orthophoto for faster loading** (recommended):
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_and_optimize.sh && ./setup_and_optimize.sh
   ```
   See [QUICK_FIX.md](QUICK_FIX.md) for details.

2. **Start the web server**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 3004
   ```

3. **Open in browser**: http://localhost:3004

## Performance

- **Original orthophoto**: 331MB (slow loading)
- **Optimized version**: ~82MB at 50% scale (3-4x faster!)

The optimization scripts create `odm_orthophoto_web.tif` which loads much faster while preserving good quality.

## Features

- Interactive map with Leaflet
- Orthophoto overlay with adjustable opacity
- Measurement tools (distance and area)
- Point cloud visualization support
- Camera positions display

## Optimization

If the map loads slowly, run the optimization:
```bash
./setup_and_optimize.sh
```
